## What This Actually Is

Local SEO Skills is a Claude SEO tool built from the ground up for local search visbility. The skills are the expertise. The MCPs are the data. Scheduled tasks are the automation engine. Briefs are the memory. Claude is the software and intelligence.

With Local SEO Skills fully configured:

- Rankings are monitored weekly — you get alerted when something moves
- Reviews are monitored daily — unanswered reviews get drafted responses 
  for your approval
- GBP changes are caught immediately — unauthorized edits trigger instant 
  alerts
- Monthly reports are generated and queued for approval before going 
  to clients
- Quarterly audits run automatically — citations, content, competitive 
  position
- Every engagement builds a searchable history — ask "why did rankings 
  drop in March?" and get a real answer

No SaaS infrastructure. No servers. Runs on Anthropic's cloud with tools you already have connected.

## Default Data Source: Local SEO Data

[Local SEO Data](https://localseodata.com) is the default data tool for Local SEO Skills. It covers 36 endpoints across SERP data, business intelligence, audits, reviews, citations, keywords, AI visibility, competitor analysis, and geogrid scans — all through a single MCP connection.

Other tools (Local Falcon, Ahrefs, Semrush, etc.) are positioned as specialists for things LocalSEOData doesn't cover: geogrid trend reports, deep backlink analysis, full site crawls, and actual traffic data.

See [tool routing](docs/tool-routing.md) for the full decision tree.

## Briefs

Briefs are persistent work state for local SEO engagements. Claude creates and maintains them automatically — one per location. When you mention a business for the first time, Claude asks 5 questions, runs an initial audit, sets up the brief, and offers to configure scheduled tasks. No manual setup required.

```
briefs/
  keystone-insurance/
    _brand.brief.md          ← config + rollup across all locations
    buffalo/
      location.brief.md      ← always current, always lean
      reports/               ← weekly, monthly, QBR
      scans/                 ← geogrid, citations, page audits
      drafts/                ← GBP posts, review responses (awaiting approval)
      alerts/                ← monitoring alerts
```

After months of scheduled tasks writing to a brief, you can ask "why did rankings drop in March?" and get a real answer from the history. No other local SEO tool does this.

Briefs are gitignored — client data never touches the repo.

See [briefs/README.md](briefs/README.md) for the full system.

## Installation

### Claude Code / Cowork (recommended for full automation)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/garrettjsmith/localseoskills.git ~/.claude/skills/localseoskills
```

Connect MCP tools in Claude settings. Then just mention a business — Claude handles the rest.

### Claude.ai Browser / Desktop

Skills load account-wide via Settings → Customize → Skills.

The Skills upload expects one skill per zip. For LocalSEOSkills (38 skills), use Claude in Chrome to import all skills at once:

```
Go to github.com/garrettjsmith/localseoskills, find all the SKILL.md files,
and add them to my Claude Skills or a new Project called "Local SEO Skills".
```

Takes 60-90 seconds. One time.

For scheduled tasks, use Claude Code on the web at claude.ai/code/scheduled — available to all paid plans, runs on Anthropic's cloud without your computer.

### API (Custom Skills)

Include skill content directly in your system prompt. Fetch the relevant
SKILL.md files from this repo and pass them as system context in your
`/v1/messages` request.

### Other Platforms (OpenClaw, Perplexity Computer, custom agents)

Skills and briefs are platform-agnostic markdown. Any LLM can use them as context.

Scheduled tasks and MCP connections are Claude-native. For other platforms, implement the scheduling and delivery layers using your own infrastructure. The task files, output file schema, approval workflow, and notification formats in `specs/` are the portable spec.

## Usage

Once installed, just ask Claude about local SEO. If you mention a specific business Claude doesn't have a brief for yet, it'll ask 5 quick questions and set everything up automatically.

```
"Audit Mike's Plumbing in Buffalo"
→ Claude checks for brief → none found → runs first run setup → audits

"Why am I not in the map pack?"
→ gbp-optimization + localseodata-tool (local_pack, business_profile)

"Run a geogrid scan for 'plumber near me' in Buffalo"
→ geogrid-analysis + localseodata-tool (geogrid_scan)

"How do I show up in ChatGPT for local searches?"
→ ai-local-search + localseodata-tool (ai_visibility, ai_mentions)

"Are my citations consistent?"
→ local-citations + localseodata-tool (citation_audit)

"Who are my competitors and where am I losing?"
→ local-competitor-analysis + localseodata-tool (competitor_gap, backlink_gap)

"Check my LSA rankings over time"
→ lsa-spy-tool + lsa-ads

"Pick up where we left off on Keystone Insurance"
→ brief → reads brief → summarizes state → asks what's next
```
