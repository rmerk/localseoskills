## Tool Overlap Guide

Some tools cover similar ground. Here's when to use which:

### Keyword Research
- **Semrush**: Primary — best keyword tool with volume, difficulty, gap analysis
- **Ahrefs**: Secondary — good keywords but better for links
- **DataForSEO**: Use when you need 100+ keywords at once
- **SerpAPI**: Use for live SERP feature detection, not volume data
- **GSC**: Use for actual query performance (what you already rank for)

### Backlink Analysis
- **Ahrefs**: Primary — largest backlink index
- **Semrush**: Secondary — decent backlinks, better for keywords
- **DataForSEO**: Use for bulk backlink data at scale

### Citation Management
- **BrightLocal**: Primary if MCP connected — full audit + building + monitoring
- **Whitespark**: Primary for highest-quality managed citation building
- Use both together: Whitespark to build, BrightLocal to monitor

### Rankings
- **Local Falcon**: Map pack rankings across geography (geogrid)
- **Semrush**: Organic position tracking at a single point
- **BrightLocal**: Basic local rank tracking
- **SerpAPI**: Single live SERP snapshot
- **DataForSEO**: Build custom ranking tools at scale

### Search Performance
- **GSC**: Ground truth for organic clicks, impressions, queries
- **GA4**: Website traffic, conversions, behavior
- Use both together: GSC for "how do people find me" + GA4 for "what do they do after"
